Certainly! Here's a personal project idea incorporating Go, HTMX, and a graph database:

Project Title: Graph-Based Task Manager

Project Overview:
Create a task management application that utilizes a graph database to model and manage relationships between tasks, projects, and users. The application will be built using the Go programming language for the backend, HTMX for dynamic updates on the frontend, and a graph database like Neo4j or Dgraph for storing and querying the task graph.

Key Features:

1. User Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication and authorization using Go's built-in authentication libraries or third-party packages like JWT authentication.

2. Task and Project Management: Users can create, edit, and delete tasks and projects. Tasks can have dependencies on other tasks, forming a graph structure. Projects can contain multiple tasks and users.

3. Graph Visualization: Utilize a library like D3.js to visualize the task graph on the frontend. Users can see dependencies between tasks and visualize project timelines.

4. Real-time Updates with HTMX: Implement real-time updates using HTMX to reflect changes made by other users without needing to refresh the page.

5. Integration with Graph Database: Use a graph database like Neo4j or Dgraph to store and query the task graph efficiently. Implement functionality to update the graph database based on user actions.

6. Notifications and Reminders: Implement notifications and reminders for upcoming tasks and deadlines. Users can receive notifications via email or in-app notifications.

7. Search and Filter: Allow users to search and filter tasks based on various criteria such as status, priority, due date, etc.

8.  RESTful API: Develop a RESTful API using Go to interact with the frontend and perform CRUD operations on tasks, projects, and users.

9. Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive and works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

10. Documentation and Testing: Provide comprehensive documentation for developers to understand the project structure and API endpoints. Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.

This project will give you hands-on experience with Go, HTMX, and graph databases while building a practical and useful application for managing tasks and projects. Additionally, it offers opportunities to explore concepts like real-time web applications, graph data modeling, and user authentication.
